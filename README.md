```lrc
[01:58.77] Stand together like we're rocks in a wall
[02:03.58] Growing stronger everyday even more
[02:07.90] Stand together in the eye of the storm
[02:12.04] And show the whole world who we are, oh
[02:31.54] 
[02:17.10] Keep on walking to the sound of the drums
[02:21.68] Feel the fire run through our lungs
[02:26.17] Find our treasure in the light of the sun
[02:30.47] And show the whole world who we are, oh
